Introduction
============

This is a Python extension to interface with Dazuko.  It provides
a simple wrapper for the C library.  An example application
demonstrating how to interface with Dazuko is provided as well.

This Python extension is part of the Dazuko distribution and was
released under the BSD license.  The original implementation was
done by Gerhard Sittig.  Stefan Grundmann improved the style of the
extension (provide an OO interface, use thread safe routines).

Installing the module
=====================

You have to build the dazuko C library before you will be able to
continue here.  If you haven't done so before, issue the following
command:

$ make -C ../library

The installation of this module is done with the usual steps,
while the below notes should be taken into consideration:

$ python setup.py build
# python setup.py install

Or alternatively use the Makefile wrappers:

$ make all
# make install

Note: Since one of the include paths is relative and python's
distutils package might not handle this situation too well you
might have to convert these relative path specs into absolute
pathnames.  Use your favourite editor on the setup.py file or
make use of the "make fixmk" target (although this target could
easily have bugs -- use it with care!).  All this does not apply
and is no problem when the dazuko library and its header file
were installed in a system wide location.

Testing the module
==================

Once the dazuko.so extension was installed (with the above
"make install" or "python setup.py install" steps) you can try
the simple example.py script.  Since dazuko only allows root
processes to register this has to be done as the "root" user.
You have to pass in the directory to watch.

# python example.py `pwd`

You should see output running over the screen when you start
accessing files in the specified directory.  Stop the example
program with CTRL-C.

Developing applications
=======================

See 'pydoc dazuko' for details how to interface with Dazuko.


Developer's Notes
=================

- better handle relative path specs for includes
- fill in license, platform for "setup.py sdist", copyright for "setup.py bdist_rpm"
- how and where to put the pydoc stuff?  "pydoc dazuko" is not too nice
