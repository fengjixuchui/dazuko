A PHP binding for Dazuko was made by Oliver Welter and can be downloaded
from http://pecl.php.net/package/dazuko.  It is available under the PHP
license (see http://www.php.net/license/3_0.txt).  The basic steps to
install and test it are:

  $ gunzip < dazuko-0.42.tgz | tar xf -
  $ pear build
  # cp dazuko-0.42/dazuko.so /usr/lib/php/extensions/... (or "pear install"?)
  [ add "extension = dazuko.so" to the "[PHP]" section of php.ini ]
  # php -q dazuko-0.42/examples/dazuko_multi_threaded.php
  [ access any files under the /etc hierarchy ]

The extension does not know about the example_php/../dazukoio.h and
example_php/../library layout and instead expects to find these
components in /usr/include (or /usr/local/include) and /usr/local/lib,
respectively.  Make sure to have the files available there or use the
appropriate --with-dazuko config option.
